    <h1>Week 5: The Soul-Crushing Nail-Biter</h1>
    <div class="score loss">Steely-eyed Rodgers! (125.10) vs. Off in Church (120.46)</div>

    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>Oh, this one is just brutal. This is the most painful kind of loss.</p>
    <p>Your team actually showed up! You crushed your 104.69 projection by 16 points. Javonte Williams and David Montgomery were monsters. And you *still* lost.</p>
    <p>You lost by <strong>4.64 points</strong>. Let's look at the man responsible:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Culprit: Juwan Johnson (TE)</b></li>
        <li><b>His Score: 2.70 points.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your tight end had scored just 7.35 points—not a great game, just a *competent* one—you would have won. Instead, Juwan Johnson gave you 17 yards and a loss.</p>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>A spectacular, soul-crushing defeat. You snatched failure from the jaws of a massive victory.</p>
