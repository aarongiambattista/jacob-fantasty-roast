    <h1>🔥 Week 8: The "I Started an Injured Player" Loss</h1>
    
    <div class="score loss">Big Ol' TDs (98.82) vs. Off in Church (94.54)</div>

    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>This loss is 100% your fault, and it's almost unbelievable. You lost by <strong>4.28 points</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Why? Because you started <strong>Mike Evans</strong>, who was on <strong>INJURED RESERVE (IR)</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>He scored <strong>0.00 points</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Your team actually played well! Rashee Rice, Javonte Williams, and Cade Otton all showed up. But it didn't matter, because you were playing with one hand tied behind your back.</p>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>You lost by 4.28 points because you started a player who was *not even playing*. This isn't bad luck. This isn't a bad beat. This is pure, unadulterated incompetence. You literally had an empty, 0-point slot on your roster. This is the single most embarrassing way to lose a fantasy matchup.</p>
