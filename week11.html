    <h1>Week 11: Demolished by the Big Dogs</h1>
    <div class="score loss">Hold my Josh Strap (126.10) vs. Off in Church (103.58)</div>

    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>This is a fitting end. You got absolutely steamrolled by the 1st place team. This loss is almost a "mercy killing."</p>
    <p>Your team *actually* beat its 93.98 projection by 10 points! And you *still* lost by 23.</p>
    <p>The perfect chef's kiss on this season of incompetence:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>San Francisco DEF: -3.00 points</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You started a defense that gave you NEGATIVE points.</p>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>This game proves that even when your team plays well, it's still not good enough. You're just a 10th-place team living in a 1st-place team's world. A total mismatch.</p>
