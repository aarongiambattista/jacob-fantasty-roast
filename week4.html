    <h1>Week 4: The 21-Point Choke Job</h1>
    <div class="score loss">The Dizzle Drizzle (103.78) vs. Off in Church (81.38)</div>

    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>This is a classic, unmitigated disaster. Your team failed to even show up, scoring <strong>81.38</strong> on a <strong>102.53</strong> projection. That is a 21-point choke.</p>
    <p>This was an "All-Bust" lineup for the ages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Geno Smith:</b> 9.78 points. Awful.</li>
        <li><b>Jakobi Meyers:</b> 5.00 points. Pathetic.</li>
        <li><b>Ladd McConkey:</b> 1.60 points. It's honestly hard to be *that* bad.</li>
        <li><b>David Montgomery:</b> 1.20 points. A complete no-show.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>A complete and total team failure. This is what happens when you build a team out of hopes and dreams. Over half your roster scored in the single digits.</p>
