    <h1>🔥 Week 1: The Kaleb Johnson Debacle</h1>
    <h2>Score: Chubawumba (112.18) vs. Off in Church (82.92)</h2>
    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>You were projected to win this. The algorithm *believed* in you (109.23 to 108.06). But you found a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>
    <p>Let's break down this masterpiece of mismanagement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Star of the Show: Kaleb Johnson (RB)</b>
            <ul><li>Projection: 7.98</li><li><b>Actual: -0.20</b></li></ul>
            <p>You started a player who scored NEGATIVE POINTS. He actively *cost* you the game. You would have scored 0.20 more points by literally starting no one. An empty roster spot was a better strategic move.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>The Disappearing Act: Mike Evans (WR)</b>
            <ul><li>Projection: 14.03</li><li><b>Actual: 7.60</b></li></ul>
            <p>Mike Evans clearly thought the game was on Tuesday. A pathetic performance from a WR1.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>You lost this game on a single, catastrophic decision: trusting Kaleb Johnson. A truly historic failure.</p>
