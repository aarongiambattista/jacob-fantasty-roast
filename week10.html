    <h1>Week 10: Saved By One Player</h1>
    <div class="score">Off in Church (98.94) vs. Browns in the Super Bowl (96.26)</div>

    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>Another win that's just... sad. You were projected to lose (95.13 to 99.89) but "squeaked by" with a 2.68-point victory.</p>
    <p>Let's be clear: *you* didn't win this. <strong>Jaxson Dart (27.24)</strong> won this for you. He single-handedly carried the team on his back.</p>
    <p>The rest of the team was a disaster, led by Javonte Williams, who was projected for 15.08 and delivered a pathetic <strong>6.80</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>This is the definition of "a quarterback saving an otherwise garbage team." You won by riding the coattails of a single player. A lucky, pathetic win.</p>
