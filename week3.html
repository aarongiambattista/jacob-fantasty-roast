    <h1>Week 3: The Pillow Fight of the Century</h1>
    <div class="score">Off in Church (87.50) vs. Cheezus (72.12)</div>

    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>Let's not celebrate this. Your team scored <strong>87.50 points</strong> on a <strong>108.21 projection</strong>. You missed your own expectations by over 20 points. Your team was objectively terrible.</p>
    <p>You only won because you were playing "Cheezus," who put up an apocalyptic 72.12 points. This wasn't a game; it was a pillow fight.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Russell Wilson:</b> A hilarious 5.10-point disaster.</li>
        <li><b>Ladd McConkey:</b> A 6.10-point bust.</li>
        <li><b>The Saviors:</b> David Montgomery (28.90) and Saquon Barkley (18.19) had to drag the rest of this decomposing roster across the finish line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>Your team was awful, but your opponent managed to be *even more* awful. This is the saddest win of the season.</p>
