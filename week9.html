    <h1>Week 9: The "Unskilled and Lucky" Escape</h1>
    <div class="score">Off in Church (128.52) vs. The Tonight Shnow (121.38)</div>

    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>A classic "unskilled and lucky" victory. You were projected to get *smoked* (99.13 to 108.60).</p>
    <p>Your team won *only* because two players had massive, unpredictable games that saved your entire week:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Saquon Barkley:</b> 31.40 points</li>
        <li><b>Rashee Rice:</b> 21.00 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Meanwhile, you still did your best to lose, starting <b>Dalton Schultz (3.40)</b> and the <b>49ers DEF (2.00)</b>.</p>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>You got bailed out. This isn't a "win"; it's a "survived" in spite of your own bad management. A truly lucky escape.</p>
