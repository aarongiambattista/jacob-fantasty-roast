    <h1>Week 7: Humiliated by the Last Place Team</h1>
    <div class="score loss">Not A Jinx (98.26) vs. Off in Church (77.64)</div>

    <h3>Analysis of Failure</h3>
    <p>This is an all-time low. Getting blown out by "Not A Jinx," the 3-7-0 12th-place team, is a new level of failure. This is arguably your worst loss of the season.</p>
    <p>Your team scored <strong>77.64</strong> on a <strong>103.81</strong> projection. That's a 26-point collapse. It's a public shaming.</p>
    <p>The Hall of Shame for this week:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Saquon Barkley:</b> 7.70 (Projected 15.62)</li>
        <li><b>Jakobi Meyers:</b> 5.90 (Projected 13.43)</li>
        <li><b>Javonte Williams:</b> 5.90 (Projected 14.36)</li>
        <li><b>And the MVP of Failure, Juwan Johnson:</b> A heroic <strong>0.50 points</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>A complete, top-to-bottom team collapse. You lost to the worst team in the league because your entire roster decided to take the week off.</p>
