    <h1>Week 2: The "Won by Default" Victory</h1>
    <div class="score">Off in Church (102.30) vs. Never a McBride (99.80)</div>
    
    <h3>Analysis of Failure (His Opponent's, Not His)</h3>
    <p>This is not a "win." This is a "technicality." You were projected to lose (115.46 to 122.89), and you only won because your opponent's team completely imploded.</p>
    <p>"Never a McBride" was projected for 122.89 and only put up 99.80. They left 23 points on the table. You didn't win; they lost.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Real MVP:</b> Aaron Jones Sr., who your opponent started. He scored a pathetic <strong>2.30 points</strong> on a 10.74 projection.</li>
        <li>Your own team was fine, but let's be clear: you backed into this victory. You didn't earn it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>A win is a win, but this one has a giant asterisk next to it. You won by default. Don't get cocky.</p>
